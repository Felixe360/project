**Problem:**
One of Ben Graham Notable quotes is “In the short run, the stock market is a voting machine. But in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” This quote has been brought up by many investors over the past few years and has gained more attention. It essentially draws on the idea that in the short run, fear and greed are powerful market forces that drive market price in either direction. This can be due to sentiment from news, rumors, and emotions which creates big price movements that don't reflect the true price of the underlying asset. This research project uses the voting machine idea and incorporates sentiment of companies into the weights of the portfolio. 

**Objective:**
Construct a portfolio that: 
- maximizes return
- minimizes risk
- takes sentiment into account.
